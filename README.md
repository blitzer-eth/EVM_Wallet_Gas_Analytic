# 📊 EVM Wallet Gas Analytics

**[View Dashboard on Dune](https://dune.com/blitzer/evm-wallet-gas-analytics)**

This dashboard offers an expansive view of a wallet's financial footprint across the entire Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) ecosystem. It tracks cross-chain gas expenditures, high-value transactions, and protocol engagement.

The suite is designed to help power users and analysts understand their cumulative costs and interaction patterns across **11+ blockchains**, including Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, and more.

## 🔍 Query Breakdown

### 1. Multi-Chain ETH Gas Spend

A holistic view of network fees paid across all supported EVM chains.

* **Cross-Chain Aggregation:** Merges gas data from Ethereum, Base, Optimism, Arbitrum, and others into a single report.
* **Market Share Analysis:** Calculates the "Daily Share," showing which blockchain accounts for the highest percentage of your total daily spend.
* **Cumulative Growth:** Tracks both individual chain totals and an "ALL" chain running total to show lifetime network costs.

### 2. Top N Highest Gas Transactions

Identifies specific instances of high network costs to help with fee optimization.

* **Historical vs. Current Value:** Compares what the gas was worth at the time of the transaction versus its value at today's market price.
* **Direct Verification:** Generates dynamic explorer links (Etherscan, Basescan, etc.) for every transaction hash.
* **Adjustable Scope:** Use parameters to filter by specific blockchains or to view your top 10, 20, or 50 most expensive txs.

### 3. Top N Protocols by Usage

An "Activity Map" that identifies which decentralized applications (dApps) you interact with most.

* **Protocol Labeling:** Automatically resolves raw contract addresses into human-readable names (e.g., "Uniswap," "Zora," or "Aave").
* **Engagement Metrics:** Ranks protocols by total transaction count and total ETH gas spent.
* **USD Tracking:** Tracks the dollar value of interactions both at the time of the call and under current market conditions.
